### **Data Is the Deal: Why Agentic-AI Transformations Live or Die on Data Quality**

**“Launch an AI agent,” the board says. “Cut costs and wow customers,” the CEO adds.**
So you spin up a large-language-model pilot… and it babbles, hallucinates, or refuses to answer at all.
Nine times out of ten the culprit isn’t the model—it’s the data you fed the poor thing.

### From “Perfect Curry” to Perfect Datasets

In my last post I compared agentic AI to a kitchen full of specialised chefs, orchestrated by a human head-cook who tastes at every step. The punch-line was simple: great curry demands fresh ingredients, a clear recipe, and disciplined tasting throughout. The same holds for AI agents—except our “ingredients” are tables, PDFs, logs, and call transcripts. Without **AI-ready data** even the smartest agent turns into digital mush.

### The Four Visible Pillars of AI-Ready Data

#### 1. Freshness

Data goes stale faster than coriander. If your customer-support bot is still reading last quarter’s pricing, expect angry tickets within minutes. Continuous pipelines, change-data-capture streams, or scheduled micro-batches—pick a method, but update **at least** as fast as your business terms change.

> **Call-out Box:** A daily batch can be “real-time” for payroll and “prehistoric” for fraud detection.

#### 2. Structure

LLMs *can* digest raw HTML, but structured formats (Parquet, well-tagged JSON, even Markdown) reduce token bloat, shorten context windows, and slash compute bills. Invest in a common data model early; retrofitting one mid-project feels like re-plumbing a skyscraper.

#### 3. Accessibility

Your model can’t fix role-based-access-control dead-ends. Make data discoverable via catalogues and describe it in plain language. “df\_customer\_202106\_bkp\_final\_FINAL.csv” fails both tests.

#### 4. Accuracy

We celebrate 99.99 % uptime for apps—then tolerate 85 % field-level accuracy in data warehouses. Agentic AI is less forgiving. Every wrong string is a potential hallucination seed.

### …and the Hidden Fifth: *Rightness*

Accuracy says the value in the field is correct; **rightness** asks whether I’m storing the *right* facts in the first place. Microsoft’s tiny Phi-2 model beats larger rivals because its creators hand-picked “textbook-quality” content—*what* went in mattered more than raw volume (Microsoft 2023). Rightness is why a 2.7-billion-parameter model trained on 1 % of the web can out-reason models ten times its size.

### Wins & Fails that Prove the Point

**🤦 The Air Canada Chatbot Debacle**
A grieving passenger asked the airline’s site about bereavement discounts; the chatbot invented a non-existent policy. Air Canada tried to blame the bot but still lost in tribunal—paying the fare difference and court costs (Forbes 2024). Root cause? Training on outdated FAQ drafts instead of the canonical tariff rules.

**🏆 JPMorgan’s Market-Mayhem MVP**
During April’s tariff-shock trading day, JPMorgan’s “Coach AI” pulled live portfolio data and research, prepping advisers 95 % faster and adding 20 % to asset-management sales (Reuters 2025). Fresh, structured, accessible—and absolutely right—data turned chaos into client love.

### Sneak Peek: Two Agents, Same Model, Different Diets

| Agent         | Training Set                                            | Persona Toggle  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Good-Data** | 200 curated Q\&A pairs, current T\&Cs, resolved tickets | Formal / Flirty |
| **Bad-Data**  | Forum scraps, outdated PDFs, random blog posts          | Formal / Flirty |

\[IMAGE: side-by-side chatbot screenshot]

I’m building an interactive demo that will live **inside this article** once it’s polished. You’ll be able to pose identical questions to both agents, flip their personas, and see how only the Good-Data version stays accurate. High-level details are locked; final examples may change after testing.

*(TODO: Embed working demo here—plus screenshots if performance warrants.)*

### Data Readiness Checklist

1. **Timeliness:** Is every critical table updated within your business SLA?
2. **Canonical Source:** Do you know which dataset is the “single source of truth” for each entity?
3. **Schema Discipline:** Are field names, types, and units documented—and enforced?
4. **Lineage & Provenance:** Can you trace any value back to its origin system *and* timestamp?
5. **Governance Gates:** Do new datasets pass validation tests before hitting production?
6. **Access Control:** Can the agent fetch what it needs without work-arounds—or security holes?
7. **Feedback Loop:** Is user feedback (thumbs-down, corrections) logged and re-fed into training?
8. **Rightness Review:** Do subject-matter experts routinely ask, “Why do we even store this field?”

Copy-paste this list, run it against one workflow, and you’ll surface thornier issues than most pricey “AI audits.”
